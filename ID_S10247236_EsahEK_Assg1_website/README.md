CafeZen is Singapore's new industrial cafe that integrates a bakery factory and a coffee roasting factory. You can enjoy delicious freshly baked bread and a cup of delicious coffee roasted on the spot in the morning. An industrial style cafe is Singapore's combination of both a bakery and coffee roastery. Enjoy freshly baked bread and coffee roasted in the same building! We are a group of coffee punks that donâ€™t go crazy with their Americanos. To create the ideal cup of coffee, the right combination of time, temperature, and expertise is required, but without premium beans that have been expertly roasted, it is all for naught.

Design Process;
The aim was to have a simple and clean look so that users can easily navigate and view the pages hence the use of monotonous colours and easy to read fonts. The website is for users who wishes to know more about Cafezen and what they offer at their cafe. The use of earthy colours is meant to enhance the feeling that Cafezen is a clean and orgranic place, which is what it wishes to represent, such as where the coffee beans are sourced from and how they are roasted in house.

For an example, as a user who wants to know what type of food is offered at Cafezen, the user can click on the Bakery button on the navigation bar and the webpage will directed it to the type of pastries and cakes available at the cafe.

Features:
Cafezen is a resposive webiste that can be viewed in both laptop and mobile view, to cater to mobile users, the navigation bar resizes into a pop up menu that is placed on the right hand side for easy access and one handed phone users. Content within the webpage have been resized into a single coloum for easy viewing and ample white spaces have been used bewteen sections so that user need not strain their eyes while viewing. Social meida icon have also been placed at the footer of the page and linked to the respective social pages so user can view more or learn about Cafezen via other means. Some additional features to be implemented in the future would be to have a hover effect over the bakery food items, this would display the ingredients used in the pastries so that users with dietry restrictions can check if they are able to consume the items. One more additional feature would be to have a "scroll to the top button" so that user need not scroll or swipe all the way to the top to access the navigation bar. 

Technologies Used:
Adobe XD - to construct the wireframe of the website
HTML - used to code the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements
CSS -  used to define styles of the web pages, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
Javascript - used to create interactive navigation bar

Testing:

Contact form - 
Go to Homepage last section before the footer
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
Try to submit the form with the correct deatils and verify that the page doesnt reload and a success message pops up. 

In order to accommodate mobile users, Cafezen is a responsive website that can be seen in both laptop and mobile views. The navigation bar shrinks into a pop-up menu that is located on the right side of the screen for quick access for one-handed phone users. The webpage's content has been reduced into a single column for ease of seeing, and enough of white space has been used between parts so that users won't have to strain their eyes.

Ran into a small issue while coding the 3 line menu in mobile as the js code wasnt reading the html file as I have used icons from font awesome, I had to figure out a way to inculde this into js as well. After testing a few verisons on how to code for the 3 line menu, I finally firgured our a way to do it which was to separate the icon from the nav and have it in its own div container.
